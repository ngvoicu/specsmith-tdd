## Isolation Patterns

| Pattern | Isolation Approach | Speed | Fidelity | When to Use |
|---------|-------------------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Unit (pure logic) | No deps; pure functions | Fastest (<1ms) | Low | Business rules, calculations, transformations |
| Unit (with deps) | Mock/stub collaborators | Fast (~1-10ms) | Medium | Service layer, handlers with injected deps |
| Integration (DB) | Testcontainers or test DB | Medium (~100ms-1s) | High | Repository layer, migrations, queries |
| Integration (HTTP) | MSW / WireMock / VCR | Medium (~10-100ms) | High | API clients, webhook handlers |
| Contract | Pact / Schema validation | Medium (~10-100ms) | High | Service boundaries, API contracts |
| E2E | Full stack running | Slow (~1-30s) | Highest | Critical user flows, smoke tests |

## Anti-Patterns

Avoid these patterns in test suites. They create fragile, slow, or misleading tests.

### 1. In-Memory DB Substitutes

Using SQLite as a stand-in for PostgreSQL or H2 for MySQL. Different engines
have different SQL dialects, constraint behaviors, and concurrency semantics.
Tests pass locally, fail in production.

**Instead**: Use Testcontainers with the real database engine.

### 2. Mocking Internals

Mocking private methods, internal modules, or implementation details. Tests
become tightly coupled to the implementation and break on every refactor.

**Instead**: Mock at architectural boundaries (ports/adapters). Test behavior,
not implementation.

### 3. Execution Order Dependencies

Tests that rely on other tests running first (shared state, database rows
created by earlier tests). Leads to flaky failures when tests run in parallel
or in different order.

**Instead**: Each test sets up its own state and tears it down. Use
`beforeEach` / setup fixtures.

### 4. Sleep-Based Synchronization

Using `sleep(2000)` or `time.sleep(3)` to wait for async operations.
Slow, flaky, and race-condition-prone.

**Instead**: Use polling with assertions (`waitFor`, `eventually`,
`assertj-await`), event-based synchronization, or test-specific hooks.

### 5. Snapshot Tests for Business Logic

Using snapshot tests (Jest snapshots, approval tests) to verify business logic
output. Snapshots are useful for UI regression; for logic they create
"accept whatever the code does" tests that miss actual bugs.

**Instead**: Write explicit assertions for expected values. Use
property-based tests for complex outputs.

### 6. Testing Frameworks Instead of Application Code

Writing tests that verify framework behavior ("does Express route to my
handler?") rather than application logic. Wastes time testing code you don't
own.

**Instead**: Test your handler logic directly. Trust the framework.

### 7. Overmocking

Mocking so many collaborators that the test verifies nothing except the mock
wiring. The test becomes a mirror of the implementation.

**Instead**: Prefer integration tests with real collaborators where practical.
Reserve mocking for external boundaries.

### 8. Ignoring Test Failures

Skipping or commenting out failing tests instead of fixing them. Erodes
trust in the suite.

**Instead**: Fix the test or remove it. A skipped test is invisible debt.
