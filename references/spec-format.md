# SPEC.md Format Reference (TDD)

This is the complete format specification for TDD-first spec documents. Use
this as the template when creating new specs. Every spec follows a strict
test-before-implementation structure: write tests first, then implement to
satisfy them.

## Full Template

```markdown

id: <spec-id>
title: <Human Readable Title>

# <Title>

## Overview

<2-4 sentences describing what this spec accomplishes and why. Include
enough context that someone resuming cold can understand the goal without
reading the full conversation history.>

## Requirements

- <When X happens, the system shall Y>
- <The Z component shall do W>
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] <Ambiguous requirement that needs discussion>

Requirements are lightweight acceptance criteria — what "done" looks like.
Not every spec needs them (skip for small bug fixes), but for features
they prevent scope creep and make verification clear.

## Architecture

<Include at least one diagram showing the system design. Use ASCII art for
simple flows and Mermaid for complex relationships.>

| Task | Spec Said | Actually Did | Why |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| <Task name> | <What was planned> | <What was implemented> | <Reason for the change> |
```

## Field Definitions

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | URL-safe identifier, lowercase hyphenated (e.g., `user-auth-system`) |
| `title` | Yes | Human-readable name |
| `status` | Yes | One of: `active`, `paused`, `completed`, `archived` |
| `created` | Yes | ISO date when spec was created |
| `updated` | Yes | ISO date of last modification |
| `priority` | No | `high`, `medium`, or `low` (default: medium) |
| `tags` | No | YAML array of categorization tags |

### Phase Status Markers

Phase headings include a status marker in square brackets:

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `[pending]` | Not started yet |
| `[in-progress]` | Currently being worked on |
| `[completed]` | All tasks done |
| `[blocked]` | Waiting on something external |

Only **one phase** should be `[in-progress]` at a time (though this isn't
strictly enforced — sometimes parallel phases make sense).

### Phase Structure (TDD)

Phases group by **feature area**, not by test vs implementation. Each phase
contains interleaved TEST-IMPL task pairs — each pair is one red-green-refactor
cycle:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Auth Foundation [in-progress]
- [x] [TEST-AUTH-01] Write tests for JWT verification
- [x] [IMPL-AUTH-02] Implement JWT verification -> satisfies [TEST-AUTH-01]
- [ ] [TEST-AUTH-03] Write tests for token refresh <- current
- [ ] [IMPL-AUTH-04] Implement token refresh -> satisfies [TEST-AUTH-03]
```

This is true TDD: write one test (RED), make it pass (GREEN), refactor,
then write the next test. Not batched.

### Task Format (TDD)

Tasks use markdown checkboxes with a typed task code prefix:

```markdown
- [ ] [TEST-XX-01] Write tests for user creation <- current
- [ ] [IMPL-XX-02] Implement user creation -> satisfies [TEST-XX-01]
- [ ] [TEST-XX-03] Write tests for user deletion
- [ ] [IMPL-XX-04] Implement user deletion -> satisfies [TEST-XX-03]
```

**Task codes** use the format `<TYPE>-<PREFIX>-<NN>`:

- **Type**: `TEST` for test-writing tasks, `IMPL` for implementation tasks.
- **Prefix**: A short (2-4 letter) uppercase abbreviation of the spec.
  Pick the most recognizable word or use initials:
  - `user-auth-system` -> `AUTH`
  - `api-refactor` -> `API`
  - `fix-upload-bug` -> `UPL`
- **Number**: Two-digit, auto-incrementing across ALL phases (not per-phase).
  Start at `01`. Tasks alternate TEST, IMPL, TEST, IMPL within each phase.

IMPL tasks include a `-> satisfies [TEST-XX-NN]` reference linking back to
the test task they satisfy. Each IMPL task immediately follows its TEST task.

The `<- current` marker indicates which task the AI should work on next.
Only one task should have this marker at a time.

**Task granularity**: Each task should represent roughly one focused work
session (30 min to 2 hours of work). If a task feels like it would take a
full day, break it into subtasks.

### Uncertainty Markers

Use `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` for any requirement or task where ambiguity
remains after interviews:

```markdown
- [ ] [TEST-AUTH-05] [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Write tests for rate limiting behavior
```

These markers signal that the task needs more discussion before
implementation. Don't start a task with this marker — resolve it first
(run another interview round or ask the user directly).

### Testing Architecture

The Testing Architecture section is placed after Architecture and before
Library Choices. It documents the full testing stack and strategy:

1. **Test Framework & Tools** — Table of every testing tool with version
   and purpose. Covers runners, mocking, DB testing, HTTP mocking, coverage,
   mutation testing, and E2E.
2. **Isolation Strategy** — Table mapping each architectural layer to its
   isolation approach and the services it interacts with.
3. **Coverage Targets** — Line coverage, branch coverage, and mutation
   score targets with measuring tools.
4. **Test Commands** — Exact CLI commands for running each test category.
5. **Anti-Patterns to Avoid** — Project-specific anti-patterns based on
   the stack (reference `testing-knowledge.md` for the full catalog).

### Resume Context (TDD)

The Resume Context section is freeform markdown inside a blockquote. It
should answer these questions:

1. **What just happened?** — What was completed in the last session
2. **What's the current state?** — Which files changed, what works, what doesn't
3. **TDD Phase** — Are you in RED (writing failing tests), GREEN (making
   tests pass), or REFACTOR (cleaning up while tests stay green)?
4. **Failing Tests** — List currently failing test names with brief failure reasons
5. **Last Test Run** — Exact command, timestamp, pass/fail count
6. **What's next?** — The specific next action to take
7. **Where exactly?** — File paths, function names, line ranges
8. **Any gotchas?** — Blockers, open questions, things that didn't work

**Good example:**
```markdown
> Just completed the TEST-AUTH-03 / IMPL-AUTH-04 cycle (token refresh).
> Tests pass, code refactored. Now starting the next cycle.
>
> Last Cycle: [IMPL-AUTH-04] GREEN — 5/5 pass, refactored token naming
> Current: [TEST-AUTH-05] Write OAuth callback tests
> TDD Phase: RED (about to write test, run, confirm fail)
> Last Test Run: `npm test -- --grep auth` at 14:32, 5 passed / 0 failed
>
> Next step: Write OAuth callback test in
> `tests/unit/auth/oauth.test.ts`. Test: valid code exchange, expired
> state param, invalid provider. Mock Google API with MSW.
>
> Key file: `tests/unit/auth/oauth.test.ts` (create — writing test)
> Key file: `src/auth/oauth.ts` (doesn't exist yet — will implement in IMPL-AUTH-06)
```

**Bad example:**
```markdown
> Was working on authentication tests. Made some progress.
```

### Decision Log

Track non-obvious technical decisions so you (or another AI session) can
understand why things are the way they are:

```markdown
| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-10 | Vitest over Jest | Faster execution, native ESM, same project uses Vite |
| 2026-02-10 | Testcontainers over test DB | Hermetic tests; no shared state between CI runs |
| 2026-02-11 | MSW over nock | MSW intercepts at network level; works in browser and Node |
```

Good decisions to log:
- Library/framework choices (especially testing tools)
- Architecture patterns
- Testing strategy decisions (isolation boundaries, what to mock)
- API design decisions
- Trade-offs made (speed vs fidelity, coverage vs maintenance)
- Things you tried and rejected (and why)

### TDD Log

Track the red-green-refactor cycle for each task. This creates an audit
trail showing that TDD discipline was followed:

```markdown
| Task | Red (Failure Output) | Green (Pass Output) | Refactor (Changes) |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [TEST-AUTH-01] | `Expected: 201, Received: undefined` (3 fail) | — | — |
| [IMPL-AUTH-02] | — | `3 passed, 0 failed` | Extracted shared fixtures to `test/helpers/auth.ts` |
| [TEST-AUTH-03] | `Expected rotated token, got same` (2 fail) | — | — |
| [IMPL-AUTH-04] | — | `5 passed, 0 failed` | Renamed `createToken` -> `issueAccessToken` |
```

Each TEST-IMPL pair forms one red-green-refactor cycle:
- **TEST task**: Record RED output (expected failure). GREEN comes from the next IMPL task.
- **IMPL task**: Record GREEN (tests passing) and REFACTOR changes.
- Keep entries concise — one line per task.

### Deviations

Track cases where implementation diverged from the original spec. This
happens when errors are found, assumptions prove wrong, or a better
approach is discovered during coding:

```markdown
| Task | Spec Said | Actually Did | Why |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| Token refresh | In-memory token store | Redis token store via Testcontainers | Needed TTL support for token expiry |
| Rate limiting | Custom middleware | express-rate-limit + Redis store | Battle-tested; no point reimplementing |
```

Good deviations to log:
- Tasks where the approach changed during implementation
- API signatures that differ from what was planned
- Libraries swapped for alternatives
- Tasks skipped because they turned out unnecessary
- Extra tasks added to handle discovered edge cases
- Test strategy changes (e.g., switched from mocking to integration)

**Don't log minor adjustments** (renamed a variable, reordered parameters).
Only log changes that would surprise someone reading the spec and comparing
it to the code.

## Minimal Spec Example (TDD)

For small tasks, a spec can be much simpler but still follows test-first:

```markdown

# Fix File Upload Bug

## Overview

Files over 10MB fail silently on upload. The multipart parser truncates
the stream. Need to fix the size limit and add proper error handling.

## Testing Architecture

### Test Framework & Tools

| Tool | Choice | Version | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| Test framework | Vitest | 3.0.4 | Unit and integration test runner |
| HTTP testing | Supertest | 7.1.0 | HTTP assertion library |

### Test Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npx vitest run` | Run all unit tests |
| `npx vitest run tests/integration` | Run integration tests |

## Phase 1: Upload Fix [in-progress]

- [x] [TEST-UPL-01] Write test reproducing the bug with a 15MB file
- [x] [IMPL-UPL-02] Fix multipart parser size limit in `src/upload/parser.ts` -> satisfies [TEST-UPL-01]
- [ ] [TEST-UPL-03] Write boundary tests (exactly 10MB, 10.1MB, 100MB) <- current
- [ ] [IMPL-UPL-04] Handle boundary sizes in parser -> satisfies [TEST-UPL-03]
- [ ] [TEST-UPL-05] Write test for proper error response on oversized files
- [ ] [IMPL-UPL-06] Add proper 413 error response -> satisfies [TEST-UPL-05]

---

## Resume Context

> Completed first cycle: TEST-UPL-01 (red: timeout on 15MB upload) then
> IMPL-UPL-02 (green: fixed fileSize limit in busboy config). Starting
> boundary condition tests next.
>
> Last Cycle: [IMPL-UPL-02] GREEN — 1/1 pass
> Current: [TEST-UPL-03] Write boundary tests
> TDD Phase: RED (about to write test, run, confirm fail)
> Last Test Run: `npx vitest run tests/integration/upload.test.ts` at 10:25, 1 passed / 0 failed
>
> Next step: Write boundary tests in `tests/integration/upload.test.ts`
> for exactly 10MB, 10.1MB, and 100MB. The handler is in
> `src/upload/parser.ts` using `busboy`. Fixed `limits.fileSize` in IMPL-02.

## TDD Log

| Task | Red (Failure Output) | Green (Pass Output) | Refactor (Changes) |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [TEST-UPL-01] | `Timeout: test exceeded 5000ms` | — | — |
| [IMPL-UPL-02] | — | `1 passed, 0 failed` | — |
```

## Complex Spec Example (TDD)

For larger features with multiple phases:

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-02-01 | Socket.io over raw WS | Built-in reconnection, rooms, and fallback to polling |
| 2026-02-03 | Yjs over Automerge | Better editor integration (ProseMirror/CodeMirror bindings) |
| 2026-02-05 | Room-per-document | Simpler than multiplexing, isolates failure domains |
| 2026-02-06 | Vitest over Jest for WS tests | Faster; native ESM; same runner as rest of project |
| 2026-02-08 | Awareness as separate protocol | Cursor positions need higher update frequency than doc edits |

## TDD Log

| Task | Red (Failure Output) | Green (Pass Output) | Refactor (Changes) |
|------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [TEST-RTC-01] | `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3001` (4 fail) | — | — |
| [IMPL-RTC-02] | — | `4 passed` | Extracted server config to `src/config/ws.ts` |

| [IMPL-RTC-10] | — | `16 passed` | — |
| [TEST-RTC-11] | `module not found` (2 fail) | — | — |
| [IMPL-RTC-12] | — | `18 passed` | Extracted provider config to `src/config/crdt.ts` |

## Deviations

| Task | Spec Said | Actually Did | Why |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----|
| WS authentication | JWT in query params | JWT in first message after connect | Query params are logged by proxies — security risk |
