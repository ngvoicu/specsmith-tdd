# Command Contracts

This file defines functional contracts for `commands/*.md` and the universal
`SKILL.md` behavior. Use it as a review checklist before releases.

## Global Contracts

1. `SPEC.md` frontmatter is authoritative; registry is denormalized.
2. Exactly one active spec should exist after any write operation.
3. All write workflows update `SPEC.md` first, then recompute/update registry.
4. Forge workflow never writes application code.
5. Phase markers use `[pending]`, `[in-progress]`, `[completed]`, `[blocked]`.
   Task lines use checkboxes and `<- current`; tasks are not tagged `[blocked]`.

## Command Contracts

### `/specsmith-tdd:forge`

1. Resolve `<spec-id>` before research output paths are referenced.
2. Collision-check existing spec IDs before creating new files.
3. Forge must not run in plan mode; if plan mode is active, require exit before
   continuing (Claude Code only — other tools proceed normally).
4. Create `.specs/<spec-id>/` directory before spawning the researcher or
   writing any research output.
5. Output scope is `.specs/` artifacts only (`research-*.md`, `interview-*.md`,
   `SPEC.md`, `registry.md` updates).
6. After approval, handoff to `/specsmith-tdd:implement` instead of implementing
   inside forge.

### `/specsmith-tdd:implement`

1. Supports scope parsing: current flow, phase-specific, all phases, task code.
2. For each completed task: checkbox + current marker + phase markers +
   frontmatter `updated` + registry progress/date.
3. Blocked handling:
   - Keep blocked tasks unchecked.
   - Mark phase `[blocked]` only when the phase is blocked.
   - Record blocker context in Resume Context/Decision Log/Deviations as needed.

### `/specsmith-tdd:resume`

1. If no active spec exists, list specs and request target.
2. Include progress, current phase/task, and Resume Context in output.

### `/specsmith-tdd:pause`

1. If no active spec exists, report no-op and stop.
2. Persist detailed Resume Context with concrete file/function references.
3. Set status `paused` and sync registry.

### `/specsmith-tdd:switch`

1. Validate target ID and target `SPEC.md` existence before pausing current spec.
2. If target already active, report and stop.
3. Pause current (if any), activate target, resume target, sync registry.

### `/specsmith-tdd:list`

1. Handle missing registry gracefully.
2. Group by status in order: active, paused, completed, archived.
3. If `SPEC.md` missing for a row, keep row visible and flag it.

### `/specsmith-tdd:status`

1. Show detailed phase/task breakdown for active spec.
2. If no active spec, guide to activate one.

### `/specsmith-tdd:openapi`

1. Generate/update `.openapi/openapi.yaml` and `.openapi/endpoints/*.md`.
2. Preserve manual additions when updating existing files.
3. Report endpoint/schema/security counts and manual-review candidates.

## Universal Skill Contract

1. `SKILL.md` must include cross-tool behavior for all declared triggers.
2. If `generate openapi` is listed as a trigger, OpenAPI workflow behavior must
   be defined in `SKILL.md` (not only plugin command files).
3. Command-specific docs can specialize behavior but cannot violate critical
   invariants from `SKILL.md`.
4. `SKILL.md` must be self-contained for standalone users (`npx skills add`).
   Any content essential for spec creation must be inlined (e.g., the SPEC.md
   template skeleton). References to `references/*.md` and `commands/*.md`
   should be conditional ("Plugin users: see...").
5. Agent spawning (researcher) must have a graceful fallback for tools that
   don't support agents.

## TDD Contracts

These contracts enforce test-driven development discipline across all commands
and the universal skill. They are **non-negotiable** — violations break the
TDD guarantee.

### Global TDD Contracts

1. **No production code without a failing test.** Every IMPL task must have a
   corresponding TEST task that was written and executed first. If no failing
   test exists for the code being written, stop and write the test.

2. **Tests MUST be executed.** Writing a test file is not enough. The test
   runner must be invoked and the output (pass/fail counts, failure messages)
   must be recorded in the TDD Log.

3. **TDD Log updated after every task.** After completing any TEST or IMPL
   task, add a row to the TDD Log with the red/green/refactor outputs.

4. **Tasks alternate TEST-IMPL within each phase.** Phases group by feature.
   Within each phase, tasks follow the pattern: `[TEST-XX-01]`, `[IMPL-XX-02]`,
   `[TEST-XX-03]`, `[IMPL-XX-04]`. Each TEST-IMPL pair is one red-green-refactor
   cycle. No separate TEST and IMPL phases.

5. **Continuous task numbering with TEST-/IMPL- prefixes.** Task codes
   increment across all phases: `[TEST-XX-01]`, `[IMPL-XX-02]`,
   `[TEST-XX-03]`, `[IMPL-XX-04]`, etc. No resets per phase.

6. **IMPL tasks immediately follow their TEST tasks.** Every IMPL task line
   includes `-> satisfies [TEST-XX-NN]` linking to the test it makes pass.
   The IMPL task is always the next task after its TEST task.

7. **Refactor only when green.** Refactoring (renaming, extracting, restructuring)
   happens only after all tests pass. Refactoring must not change test outcomes.

8. **Test isolation.** Each test is independent. No test relies on another test's
   side effects. Tests can run in any order and produce the same results.

8b. **Tests are sacred.** Tests define expected behavior. During the GREEN phase,
    if tests fail, fix the production code — never modify test assertions to match
    what the code returns. The only reason to touch a test is an actual bug (wrong
    import, syntax error, broken fixture). If a test expectation seems wrong, STOP
    and ask the user before changing it.

### Forge TDD Contracts

9. **Testing Architecture section required.** Every spec produced by forge MUST
   include the Testing Architecture section (framework, tools, isolation
   strategy, coverage targets, test commands, anti-patterns). Specs without
   this section are incomplete.

10. **Testing interview questions.** During the interview phase, forge MUST ask
    at least 2 questions about testing preferences:
    - Preferred test framework and runner (or detect from project)
    - Integration test strategy (Testcontainers, test DB, mocks)
    - Coverage expectations
    - Any existing testing patterns to follow

11. **Interleaved task structure.** Forge MUST produce phases with alternating
    TEST-IMPL task pairs. A phase with all TEST tasks followed by all IMPL tasks
    is invalid. The correct structure is: `[TEST-XX-01] Write test`, then
    `[IMPL-XX-02] Implement -> satisfies [TEST-XX-01]`, then
    `[TEST-XX-03] Write test`, then `[IMPL-XX-04] Implement -> satisfies [TEST-XX-03]`.
    Phases group by feature area, not by test vs implementation.

12. **Research includes test infrastructure.** The researcher agent MUST
    analyze the project's existing test infrastructure (framework, patterns,
    coverage tools, anti-patterns) as part of the research phase.

### Implement TDD Contracts

13. **Red-green-refactor enforcement per task pair.** During implementation,
    each TEST-IMPL pair follows:
    - TEST task: write test, run, confirm fail (RED)
    - IMPL task: write minimum code, run, confirm pass (GREEN)
    - REFACTOR: clean up, run, confirm still green
    Then move to the next TEST-IMPL pair. This is true TDD — one cycle at a
    time, not batched.

14. **Blocking rule: per-task, not per-phase.** Each IMPL task MUST NOT start
    until its corresponding TEST task is completed and tests are confirmed
    failing. This is enforced at the task level. An IMPL task cannot run
    before its TEST task, regardless of phase boundaries.

15. **Test execution mandate — 3 runs per cycle.** The implement command MUST
    run tests via Bash at every RED, GREEN, and REFACTOR transition. That is 3
    runs minimum per TEST-IMPL cycle. Claims like "tests would pass" are never
    acceptable. The exact command from the spec's Testing Architecture is used.

16. **Failed tests block progress — fix code, not tests.** If tests fail after
    an IMPL task, fix the production code and run again. Never modify test
    assertions to make them pass. Tests define expected behavior. The only
    reason to touch a test is an actual bug (wrong import, syntax error,
    broken setup). If a test expectation seems genuinely wrong, STOP and ask
    the user.

17. **TDD Log is mandatory.** The implement command MUST update the TDD Log
    table after each task. Missing TDD Log entries indicate the TDD process
    was not followed.

### Resume TDD Contracts

18. **TDD phase indicator.** Resume output MUST include the current TDD phase
    (RED, GREEN, or REFACTOR) and list any currently failing tests. This
    information comes from the Resume Context section of the spec.

### Pause TDD Contracts

19. **TDD state capture.** When pausing, the pause command MUST record:
    - Current TDD phase (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR)
    - List of currently failing tests (if any)
    - Last test run command and results
    This information is written to the Resume Context section.

### Status TDD Contracts

20. **TDD indicators in status output.** The status command MUST show:
    - Current TDD phase (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR)
    - TEST vs IMPL task counts and completion per phase
    - Number of TDD Log entries vs expected entries
    - Last test run results summary

## Icon Standards

All commands and SKILL.md must use these standardized icons:

**Registry-level** (active/paused/completed specs):
- `->` active
- `||` paused
- `+` completed

**Task-level** (done/in-progress/pending):
- `+` done
- `->` in-progress / current
- `o` pending

## Release Checklist

1. `claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json` passes.
2. `claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/marketplace.json` passes without
   warnings.
3. Paths referenced in docs and templates exist (excluding placeholder paths).
4. Command contracts in this file still match `commands/*.md` and `SKILL.md`.
5. TDD contracts are enforced by all commands and the universal skill.
6. `SKILL.md` is self-contained for standalone use (spec template inlined,
   researcher fallback documented).
7. Status icons are consistent across all files (see Icon Standards above).
